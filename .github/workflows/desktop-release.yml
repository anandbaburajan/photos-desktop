name: "Release"

# This will create a new draft release with public artifacts.
#
# Note that a release will only get created if there is an associated tag
# (GitHub releases need a corresponding tag).
#
# The canonical source for this action is in the repository where we keep the
# source code for the Ente Photos desktop app: https://github.com/ente-io/ente
#
# However, it actually lives and runs in the repository that we use for making
# releases: https://github.com/ente-io/photos-desktop
#
# We need two repositories because Electron updater currently doesn't work well
# with monorepos. For more details, see `docs/release.md`.
